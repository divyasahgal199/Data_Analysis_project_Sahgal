Step 1: Load the Dataset
Load the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
Display basic information such as column names, data types, and the first few rows.

Step 2: Clean the Data
Check for missing values in the dataset.
Handle missing values by either dropping rows/columns or filling them with appropriate values.
Ensure data types are correct for numerical and categorical columns.

Step 3: Explore the Data
Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of numerical features.
Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights.

Step 4: Visualize Key Metrics
Sales Distribution: Plot the distribution of sales values using a histogram.
Sales by Category: Group sales by category (if applicable) and visualize with a bar chart.
Gender Analysis: Analyze the sales distribution for different genders using boxplots.
Region-Wise Sales: Visualize sales across different regions with a bar chart.
Correlation Heatmap: Generate a heatmap to show correlations between numerical columns.

Step 5: Save the Cleaned Data
Export the cleaned and preprocessed data to a new CSV file for future use.

Step 6: Document and Interpret Results
Summarize the findings from visualizations and statistics.
Draw actionable insights based on the analysis.
